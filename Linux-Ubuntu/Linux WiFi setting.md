# Linux WiFi setting

several times have I been struggling with the wifi issue and my vpn. This made me resolved to fix it. Here is a record:

By search, and asking ai , the solution is:

1. unknowingly my Gnome tweak - extension term is missing. I have tried several times to tackle with it, but eventually I yielded to the mysterious bug.

2. Then I resort to CLI.

```bash
    gnome-extensions list
    gnome-extensions disable <extension-name>
    gnome-extensions enable <extension-name>
    journalctl -xe | grep gnome-tweaks
    Press Alt + F2, type r, and hit Enter. This will restart the GNOME Shell and could bring the icon back.
```

3. this helps me to find the disruption:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
   
   sudo apt install --reinstall network-manager-gnome
   
   If the Wi-Fi service itself has been disabled or is not functioning correctly, you can try bringing it up manually. 
   I check the status of the wifi
   nmcli radio wifi
   nmcli radio wifi on
   
   I check for journalctl -xe | grep -i network
   Restart the Network Manager Applet: As previously mentioned, try restarting the network applet that controls the Wi-Fi icon:
   killall nm-applet
   nohup nm-applet &
   
   systemctl status NetworkManager
   nmcli device status
   
   ```

    最后,重启总是能]]暂时地有效解决问题-不要止于注销,不要怕重启的等待=重启一下有精神.

anyway , this is just a casual log.
